Welcome to my personal website! I'm Ethan Lam, a mathematics and computer science student at National Taiwan Normal University with a passion for programming, machine learning, and education technology.

Currently pursuing a double major in Mathematics and CSIE, I enjoy combining analytical thinking with practical programming skills to solve complex problems and teach others.
